## Summary

This is the first project that I utilized game logic in Javascript to create functionality with if/else statements. This took a lot of trial and error, but I learned a lot working on this application over the past 3 weeks. I also learned about modals and more about using keyframes for basic animations of icons/images. Ran into some challenges, but I loved the process and look forward to continuously building my skills with Javascript and other languages.
